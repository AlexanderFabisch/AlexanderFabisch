The algorithm t-SNE has been merged in the master of scikit learn
[recently](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/2822). It is
a nice tool to visualize and understand high-dimensional data. A little
demonstration can be found
[here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/gist.githubusercontent.com/AlexanderFabisch/1a0c648de22eff4a2a3e/raw/59d5bc5ed8f8bfd9ff1f7faa749d1b095aa97d5a/t-SNE.ipynb).
