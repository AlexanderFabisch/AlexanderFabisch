The algorithm t-SNE has been merged in the master of scikit learn
[recently](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/2822). It is
a nice tool to visualize and understand high-dimensional data. In this post I
will explain the basic idea of the algorithm, show how the implementation
from scikit learn can be used and show some examples. The IPython notebook
that is embedded here, can be found [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/gist.githubusercontent.com/AlexanderFabisch/1a0c648de22eff4a2a3e/raw/59d5bc5ed8f8bfd9ff1f7faa749d1b095aa97d5a/t-SNE.ipynb).
