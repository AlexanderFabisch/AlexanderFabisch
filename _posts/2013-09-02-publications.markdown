I am researcher at the University of Bremen and I am currently working in the project [BesMan](http://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/research/projects/besman-1.html). My focus is at the moment on imitation learning and reinforcement learning. Previously, I have been working as a student in the RoboCup team [B-Human](http://www.b-human.de/) and I wrote my Diploma thesis in the field of artificial neural networks.
