  abstract = {We examine two methods which are used to deal with complex
              machine learning problems: compressed sensing and model
              compression. We discuss both methods in the context of
              feed-forward artificial neural networks and develop the
              backpropagation method in compressed parameter space. We
              further show that compressing the weights of a layer of a
              multilayer perceptron is equivalent to compressing the input
              of the layer. Based on this theoretical framework, we will
              use orthogonal functions and especially random projections for
              compression and perform experiments in supervised and
              reinforcement learning to demonstrate that the presented
              methods reduce training time significantly.}

  abstract = {To achieve a reasonable level of play in the RoboCup Standard
              Platform League, a number of basic abilities such as obstacle
              avoidance and passing are necessary. Most of these abilities
              have one thing in common: they rely on information about other
              robots. In this paper, we present a vision-based approach for
              robot recognition in the RoboCup Standard Platform League as
              well as an algorithm to track the recognized robots. Both
              approaches were developed considering the limited computing
              resources of the Nao to allow an application in actual games.}
